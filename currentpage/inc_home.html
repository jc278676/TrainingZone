<h1>Current Page Demonstration</h1>
<p>This page design is one of the built-in Dreamweaver ones. </p>
<p>The links on the left have their class set based on the current page 'variable', which is passed using the query string in the URL.</p>
<p>Since it is not normally helpful to have a link to the current page, the current link is also removed.</p>
